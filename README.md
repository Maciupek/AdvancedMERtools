Advanced(actually helpful) tools for SCP: SL plugin MER (Map Editor Reborn)

AutoScaler: It will help you making some grouped object scale up or down.

Rotator: It will rotate your objects like magnetic field or sphere (Or potery).

Mirror: mirroring.

Arrange: Duplicate your objects and arrange them.

NOTION: Using same script from parent to children is designed to be not errored. But just in case, please use them individually. Idk what will happen but it wouldn't be that good.
